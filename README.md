## What is reheat?

Reheat is an ORM for [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com), built for the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) platform.

#### Benefits of using reheat:
- Less code to write
- Less code to test
- Less code to maintain
- Less code that can break
- Improved sense of well-being

#### Features:
- Connection pool
- Easy Model lifecycle setup/access (`beforeUpdate()`, `afterDestroy()`, etc.)
- Robust and flexible Schema definition for your Models
- Automatic validation based on Schema
- Convert `req.query` to ReQL query (great for your app's API).
- Query builder (it's just ReQL, easy!)
- Connection and Schema can each be used on their own
- Relationships/Associations

#### Roadmap:
- Transactions (and rollbacks)
- Migrations
- You tell me!

#### Quick, what is RethinkDB?

From the RethinkDB website:

> An open-source distributed database built with love.

> Enjoy an *intuitive* query language, automatically *parallelized* queries, and *simple* administration.

> Table joins and batteries included.

RethinkDB is awesome and ReQL makes data access fun, but still, who loves writing tons of code to pull data into and out of a database? Reheat exists to eliminate boilerplate and level up your RethinkDB experience!

##### Install reheat

`npm install reheat --save`

##### Go!

```javascript
var reheat = require('reheat');

var connection = new reheat.Connection({
	db: 'local'
});

var Post = reheat.Model.extend({
	tableName: 'post',
	connection: connection
}, {
   	beforeCreate: function (cb) {
   		this.setSync('tags', []);
   		cb();
   	}
});

var post = new Post({
	author: 'Jason Dobry',
	title: 'How to reheat your app'
});

post.isNew(); // true

post.save(function (err, post) {
	post.toJSON();  //  {
					//      id: '1c83229b-1628-4098-a618-abc05af1ebdb',
					//      author: 'Jason Dobry',
					//      title: 'How to reheat your app',
					//      tags: []
					//  }

	post.isNew();   //  false
});
```
